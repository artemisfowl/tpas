Aim:
  Aim is to create a software capable of running various types of tests using REST API interface.

Todo:
  - Add the capacity to start a basic service in order to check the status of the services.

Enhancement features:
 - Allow for LunarVim or VScode for easy integration into the software.

Coding Style:
  - Always use snake_case as opposed to camelCase.
  - Imports need not be in alphabetical order, just follow the order as follows:
    - standard API imports (Eg, sys, os)
    - third-party imports (Eg, fastapi, flask, wx)
    - custom module imports 

Documentation:
  - All the files, whether directly under tpas or submodules need to have the following structure to documentation strings.

  """
    @brief A brief description of the file contents
    @author name of the author
  """
   - At times, @note can be added in the documentation in order for updating the programmer about certain specifics of a file.

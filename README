Aim:
  Aim is to create a software capable of running various types of tests using REST API interface.

Todo:
  - Add the capacity to start a basic service in order to check the status of the services.

Enhancement features:
 - Allow for LunarVim or VScode for easy integration into the software.
 - Allow for easy configuration of modules using INI files
 - Allow for getting the list of browsers installed(cross-platform implementation - Mac, Windows as well as Linux) [done]

Coding and Commenting Style:
  - Always use snake_case as opposed to camelCase.
  - Imports need not be in alphabetical order, just follow the order as follows:
    - standard API imports (Eg, sys, os)
    - third-party imports (Eg, fastapi, flask, wx)
    - custom module imports 
  - Add the information about something to be written using "# fixme: ..." and "# testme: ..." in case something needs to be tested.
    Always provide one space after the ":" in fixme or testme.

Documentation:
  - All the files, whether directly under tpas or submodules need to have the following structure to documentation strings.

  """
    - **@brief** A brief description of the file contents
    - **@param** <param_name> : <type> containing ...
    - **@return** returns a ...
    - **@author** name of the author

    **@note** note for the programmer
  """

  - At times, @note can be added in the documentation in order for updating the programmer about certain specifics of a file.
